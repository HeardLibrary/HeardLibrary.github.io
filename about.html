  <h1>What is Github? </h1>
  <p> GitHub is widely used as a tool for projects in multiple disciplines, including the humanities. It allows for version control so that if multiple people are working on a project at the same time, they won't conflict with each other while updating their code. The library has several github repositories to store, access and archive files from project isn disciplines as varied as Biodiversity and Baudelaire Studies</p>
